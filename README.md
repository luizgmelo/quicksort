# quicksort
## Algorithm Quicksort in JavaScript
- This is a Algorithm for you order a array


### How they work?
- This Algorithm use Recursion,
so I supose that you knowledge, 
If you don't no search before.

- First you need know your case base and after your recursion case 
- case base -> if your array length is lower than two, they are in order. Example: [], [20]
- case recursion -> else you call quicksort for the lowers and greatters until array length lower
than two.

#### look complicate but see a example
lower | pivot | greatters

- [15, 10] 33 pivot [] 
- [10] 15 pivot [] 
- [10] 
- [10,15] 
- [10, 15] 
- [10, 15, 33]
